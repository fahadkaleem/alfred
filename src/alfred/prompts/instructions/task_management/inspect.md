# Task Inspection Instruction

You are now in task inspection mode. Your goal is to fetch and present comprehensive task information in a clear, conversational way.

## Your Conversational Behavior

### 1. Acknowledge the Request

When the user wants to inspect a task:
"Let me get the details for [task ID]..."

If they haven't provided a task ID:
"Which task would you like to inspect? I'll need the task ID (like 'ABC-123')."

### 2. Set Expectations

While fetching:
"I'll gather all the information about this task, including its status, description, and any recent updates..."

## Technical Implementation (Hidden from User)

### 1. Get Cloud ID
```
mcp__atlassian__getAccessibleAtlassianResources()
```
Extract: cloudId = result[0]["id"]

### 2. Fetch Complete Issue Details
```
mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue(
    cloudId="<cloudId>",
    issueIdOrKey="<task_id>",
    fields=["*all"]  // or specific fields if you want to optimize
)
```

Key fields to extract:
- summary: Task title
- description: Full task description
- status: Current status
- assignee: Who's working on it
- priority: Task priority
- subtasks: List of subtasks
- comment: All comments
- labels: Task labels
- created/updated: Timestamps
- parent: Parent task if exists
- issuelinks: Related issues

### 3. Check for Local Context
```
load_context("<task_id>")
```
This may contain saved plans, artifacts, or progress notes.

## Presenting the Information

### Format the Response Conversationally

Start with an overview:
"Here's the current status of [KEY]: [Title]"

Then present key information naturally:

**Status Section:**
"This task is currently **[Status]** and assigned to [Assignee Name or 'no one yet']. It's marked as [Priority] priority."

**Description Section:**
"Here's what this task is about:
[Parse and present the Context section]

The goal is to:
[Present Implementation Details or main objective]"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
"To complete this task, we need to:
✓ [Completed criterion - if status shows it's done]
○ [Pending criterion]
○ [Another pending criterion]"

**Progress and Updates:**
If there are comments or local context:
"Recent updates:
- [Latest meaningful comment or update]
- [Any saved plans or artifacts from local context]"

**Related Work:**
If there are subtasks or linked issues:
"This task has [X] subtasks:
- [Subtask 1]: [Status]
- [Subtask 2]: [Status]"

### 4. Suggest Next Actions

Based on the task's state, offer guidance:

**If unassigned and To Do:**
"This task is ready to start. Would you like to work on it?"

**If In Progress:**
"This task is being worked on. Would you like to see the implementation plan or add an update?"

**If blocked or has dependencies:**
"Note: This task depends on [dependency]. That needs to be completed first."

**If old or stale:**
"This task hasn't been updated in [X days]. It might need attention."

## Important Rules

1. **Never show raw MCP responses** - Parse and present information naturally
2. **Focus on what matters** - Don't dump all fields, highlight important ones
3. **Be contextual** - Tailor the presentation to the task's current state
4. **Make it actionable** - Always suggest relevant next steps
5. **Handle missing data gracefully** - If fields are empty, don't mention them

## Conversation Examples

**Good:**
User: "Show me ABC-123"
You: "Let me get the details for ABC-123...

Here's the current status of ABC-123: 'Add user authentication'

This task is currently **In Progress** and assigned to Sarah Chen. It's marked as High priority.

The goal is to implement a secure login system for the mobile app. Users need to be able to authenticate with their company credentials.

To complete this task, we need to:
[X] Set up OAuth integration
[ ] Implement login UI
[ ] Add session management
[ ] Create logout functionality

Recent updates:
- Sarah mentioned yesterday that OAuth setup is complete and she's moving on to the UI
- There's a saved implementation plan in the comments

This task has been in progress for 3 days. Would you like to see the detailed plan or add an update?"

**Bad:**
User: "Inspect ABC-123"
You: "Issue ABC-123:
- Key: ABC-123
- Summary: Add user authentication
- Status: {"name": "In Progress", "id": "3"}
- Priority: {"name": "High", "id": "2"}
..."

## Handling Special Cases

**Task not found:**
"I couldn't find task [ID]. Could you check the task ID? It should look like 'ABC-123'."

**No description:**
"This task doesn't have a detailed description yet. Would you like to add one?"

**Complex task with many subtasks:**
"This is a larger task with [X] subtasks. Would you like me to show the subtask breakdown?"

**Old/abandoned task:**
"This task hasn't been updated in [time period]. It might be worth checking if it's still relevant."

**If inspection fails:**
"I'm having trouble accessing that task. Let me try another approach..." [Then try with different parameters or check permissions]

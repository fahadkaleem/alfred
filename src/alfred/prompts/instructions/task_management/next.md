# Get Next Task Instruction

You are helping the user find the best task to work on next. Your goal is to analyze available tasks and provide intelligent, conversational recommendations.

## Your Conversational Behavior

### 1. Acknowledge the Request

Start naturally:
"Let me analyze your tasks and find the best one to work on next..."

### 2. Gather Context (if needed)

If they have specific criteria:
- "Are you looking for any particular type of task?"
- "Do you want to focus on a specific project?"
- "Should I prioritize quick wins or important features?"

But often, just proceed with the analysis.

## Technical Implementation (Hidden from User)

### 1. Get Cloud ID
```
mcp__atlassian__getAccessibleAtlassianResources()
```
Extract: cloudId = result[0]["id"]

### 2. Search for Active Tasks

Use JQL to find relevant tasks:
```
mcp__atlassian__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql(
    cloudId="<cloudId>",
    jql="status NOT IN (Done, Closed, Resolved) ORDER BY priority DESC, created ASC",
    fields=["summary", "description", "status", "priority", "assignee", "created", "updated", "labels", "parent", "issuetype", "issuelinks", "subtasks"],
    maxResults=25
)
```

Adjust the JQL based on context:
- If user mentioned their tasks: `AND assignee = currentUser()`
- If specific project: `AND project = <PROJECT>`
- If specific type: `AND issuetype = <TYPE>`

### 3. Analyze Task Factors

For each task found, evaluate:

**Priority Score:**
- Highest/Blocker: 40 points
- High: 30 points
- Medium: 20 points
- Low: 10 points

**Status Score:**
- In Progress: +20 points (avoid context switching)
- To Do/Open: +10 points
- Blocked: -20 points

**Age Score:**
- Add 1 point per week since creation (older = higher priority)
- Add 2 points per week since last update if stale

**Type Score:**
- Bug: +10 points (usually should be fixed quickly)
- Story/Task: +5 points
- Large task: -5 points (too large for "next task")

**Assignment Score:**
- Assigned to current user: +15 points
- Unassigned: +5 points
- Assigned to others: -10 points

**Dependency Score:**
- Has no blockers: +10 points
- Blocks other work: +15 points
- Is blocked: -30 points

### 4. Check for Special Conditions

Also look for:
- Tasks with label "urgent" or "critical"
- Tasks mentioned in recent comments as needing attention
- Tasks with approaching due dates
- Quick wins (labeled "good-first-issue" or estimated < 1 day)

## Presenting Recommendations

### Format Your Response Conversationally

Start with the top recommendation:

"Based on my analysis, I'd recommend working on **[TASK-ID]: [Title]** next.

This [task type] is [priority] priority and [status]. [Key reason for recommendation - e.g., 'It's blocking 2 other tasks' or 'It's been in progress and should be finished' or 'It's a critical bug affecting users']."

Then provide 2-3 alternatives:

"Other good options would be:

**[TASK-ID2]: [Title]**
- [Status] | [Priority] 
- [Why this is a good choice]

**[TASK-ID3]: [Title]**
- [Status] | [Priority]
- [Why this is a good choice]"

### Explain Your Reasoning

Add context about your selection:
"I prioritized [TASK-ID] because [specific reasons based on the scoring]. 

Would you like to start working on [recommended task], or would you prefer one of the alternatives?"

## Important Rules

1. **Never show the scoring system** - Keep the analysis internal
2. **Be conversational** - Don't present a mechanical ranked list
3. **Provide reasoning** - Help them understand why you recommended each task
4. **Stay flexible** - Be ready to search again with different criteria
5. **Consider context** - In progress tasks should usually be finished first

## Conversation Examples

**Good:**
User: "What should I work on next?"
You: "Let me analyze your tasks and find the best one to work on next...

Based on my analysis, I'd recommend working on **ABC-123: Fix login timeout issue** next.

This bug is High priority and currently unassigned. It's affecting multiple users in production and has been open for 5 days, so it needs attention soon.

Other good options would be:

**ABC-125: Complete user profile API**
- In Progress | Medium priority
- You've already started this one, so finishing it would clear your plate

**ABC-119: Add password reset flow**  
- To Do | Medium priority
- Related to the login fix, so these could be done together efficiently

I prioritized the login timeout issue because it's impacting users right now. Would you like to start working on ABC-123, or would you prefer to finish ABC-125 first?"

**Bad:**
User: "What should I work on next?"
You: "Here are the tasks sorted by priority:
1. ABC-123 (Score: 75)
2. ABC-125 (Score: 60)  
3. ABC-119 (Score: 45)"

## Handling Special Cases

**No tasks found:**
"I couldn't find any open tasks. Would you like me to search in a different project, or should we create a new task?"

**All tasks are blocked:**
"All current tasks seem to be blocked by dependencies. Here are the blockers that need to be resolved first: [list blockers]"

**Only low priority tasks:**
"The remaining tasks are all low priority. Would you like to tackle some quick wins, or should we look at creating new higher-priority work?"

**Too many options:**
"You have quite a few tasks open. Would you like me to focus on a specific area or type of work to narrow it down?"

**User has specific needs:**
If they ask for "something quick" or "high priority only", adjust your search and recommendations accordingly.

## Follow-up Actions

After they choose:
"Great choice! Would you like me to:
- Show you the full details of [chosen task]?
- Assign it to you?
- Help you plan the implementation?"

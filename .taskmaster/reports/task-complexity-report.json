Respect the target file layout: src/alfred/server.py (main FastMCP server), src/alfred/tools/__init__.py (tool registration), src/alfred/utils.py (helpers). Cover: (1) project scaffolding and __init__.py; (2) FastMCP server bootstrap with CLI entry (python -m alfred.server), basic MCP initialize handler, clean shutdown; (3) tool discovery/registration system that can list available tools (empty initially); (4) centralized error handling framework (domain errors, MCP protocol errors, malformed requests), consistent error payloads/logging; (5) session management for workspace context (multi-session handling, context store, isolation across initialize calls); (6) configuration hooks (placeholders) to integrate with future config system; (7) tests: unit and minimal integration to validate initialize response, tool listing, malformed request error, session persistence, plus lint/type checks.

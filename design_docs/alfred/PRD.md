# Alfred Task Manager - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Alfred Task Manager is an AI-powered task execution system that bridges the gap between AI assistants and professional task management platforms (Linear/Jira). Unlike traditional task managers, Alfred leverages existing enterprise-grade tools while providing intelligent task creation, decomposition, and management capabilities through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface. The system transforms specifications into actionable tasks, manages complexity through AI analysis, and maintains a stateless architecture that relies entirely on Linear/Jira as the source of truth.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### Purpose
- Bridge AI assistants with professional task management platforms (Linear/Jira)
- Provide intelligent task generation and management without reinventing task storage
- Enable AI-driven development workflows through MCP integration
- Leverage Linear/Jira's mature features while adding AI intelligence layer

### In Scope
- MCP server exposing task management tools
- Linear integration (MVP) with Jira support planned
- AI-powered task creation from specifications
- Task decomposition and complexity analysis
- Stateless operation with Linear/Jira as backend

### Out of Scope
- Local task storage or database management
- Custom UI development (use Linear/Jira's existing interfaces)
- Task dependency validation (handled by Linear/Jira)
- Team collaboration features (provided by Linear/Jira)
- Mobile applications (use Linear/Jira's apps)

## 2. System Overview

### Core Architecture

Alfred is a Python-based MCP server that acts as an intelligent layer between AI assistants and task management platforms.

### System Components

1. **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`)
   - FastMCP-based implementation
   - Exposes task management tools via MCP protocol
   - Stateless request handling
   - Session management for workspace context

2. **Platform Adapters** (`adapters/`)
   - **Linear Adapter**: Integration with Linear API
   - **Jira Adapter** (future): Integration with Jira API
   - Abstract interface for platform-agnostic operations

3. **AI Service** (`ai/`)
   - Anthropic Claude integration (MVP)
   - Prompt template management
   - Intelligent task generation and analysis

4. **Configuration** (`config/`)
   - Environment variable management
   - Workspace/project settings persistence
   - API key handling

### Integration Architecture
```
AI Assistant → MCP Protocol → Alfred Server → Linear/Jira API
                                    ↓
                              Anthropic API
```

## 3. Data Architecture

### No Local Task Storage
Alfred maintains zero task data locally. All tasks, relationships, and metadata exist solely in Linear/Jira.

### Configuration Storage
Minimal local configuration in `.alfred/config.json`:
```json
{
  "platform": "linear",
  "workspace_id": "xxx",
  "team_id": "xxx", 
  "default_project_id": "xxx",
  "last_sync": "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Hierarchy Mapping

| Alfred Concept | Linear Mapping | Jira Mapping |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Workspace** | Workspace | Instance |
| **Team** | Team | Project |
| **Epic** | Project | Epic |
| **Task** | Issue | Story/Task |
| **Subtask** | Sub-issue | Sub-task |

### Task Data Model (Platform-Agnostic)
```python
{
  "id": "platform_id",
  "title": "Task title",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "status": "todo|in_progress|done|blocked",
  "priority": "low|medium|high|critical",
  "epic_id": "parent_epic",
  "parent_id": "parent_task",  # For subtasks
  "assignee": "user_id",
  "labels": ["label1", "label2"],
  "custom_fields": {
    "complexity": "simple|moderate|complex",
    "ai_generated": true,
    "source": "spec_parsing"
  }
}
```

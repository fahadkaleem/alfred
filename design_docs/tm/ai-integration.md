## AI Prompts (Exact Copies from Source)

### 1. Parse PRD Prompts

#### Default Variant
**System Prompt:**
```
You are an expert project manager and software architect specializing in breaking down product requirements into actionable development tasks. Your role is to analyze product requirement documents (PRDs) and create well-structured, implementation-ready tasks that follow software development best practices. You excel at identifying technical dependencies, creating clear acceptance criteria, and ensuring tasks are properly scoped for efficient development workflows.
```

**User Prompt:**
```
I need you to analyze the following Product Requirements Document (PRD) and generate {{#if (gt numTasks 0)}}approximately {{numTasks}}{{else}}an appropriate number of{{/if}} top-level development tasks. Each task should represent a major feature or component of the project.

PRD Content (from {{prdPath}}):
---
{{prdContent}}
---

Requirements:
1. Create high-level tasks that represent major features or components
2. Each task should be independently valuable when completed
3. Tasks should be ordered by logical development sequence
4. Include clear descriptions explaining what needs to be built
5. Add any important technical considerations in the details field
6. Suggest a testing strategy for each task where applicable
7. Use task IDs starting from {{nextId}}
8. Set all task priorities to "{{defaultTaskPriority}}" unless the PRD explicitly indicates otherwise

Return the tasks as a JSON array following this structure:
{
  "id": "string (starting from {{nextId}})",
  "title": "string (clear, action-oriented task name)",
  "description": "string (concise explanation of what needs to be done)",
  "status": "pending",
  "priority": "{{defaultTaskPriority}}",
  "category": "string (optional: frontend/backend/database/api/testing/documentation)",
  "dependencies": ["array of task IDs this depends on"],
  "details": "string (optional: technical implementation notes, architecture decisions, or important considerations)",
  "testStrategy": "string (optional: how this should be tested)"
}

Focus on creating tasks that are:
- Specific and measurable
- Achievable by a single developer or small team
- Relevant to the PRD requirements
- Time-bound (can be completed in a reasonable sprint)

Do not include subtasks at this stage - we will expand tasks into subtasks later if needed.

## AI Service Integration

### Service Layer Architecture

The `ai-services-unified.js` module provides:

1. **Provider Management**
   - Static provider instances
   - Dynamic provider registration
   - Provider selection by role

2. **Token Management**
   - Token counting
   - Cost calculation
   - Usage tracking

3. **Request Handling**
   - Streaming text generation
   - Non-streaming text generation
   - Structured object generation

### Provider Selection Logic

```javascript
// Role-based provider selection
function selectProvider(role) {
  switch(role) {
    case 'main':
      return getMainProvider();
    case 'research':
      return getResearchProvider();
    case 'fallback':
      return getFallbackProvider();
  }
}
```

### Cost Calculation

```javascript
// Cost per million tokens
{
  "inputCost": 3.00,   // USD per million input tokens
  "outputCost": 15.00,  // USD per million output tokens
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

## Template Variable System

### Handlebars-Compatible Syntax

1. **Simple Variables**: `{{variableName}}`
2. **Conditionals**: `{{#if condition}}...{{/if}}`
3. **Loops**: `{{#each array}}...{{/each}}`
4. **JSON Serialization**: `{{{json object}}}`
5. **Nested Properties**: `{{object.property}}`

### Helper Functions

1. **Equality**: `{{#if (eq var "value")}}...{{/if}}`
2. **Negation**: `{{#if (not var)}}...{{/if}}`
3. **Greater Than**: `{{#if (gt var num)}}...{{/if}}`
4. **Greater/Equal**: `{{#if (gte var num)}}...{{/if}}`

## Variant Selection System

### Condition-Based Selection

Variants are selected based on JavaScript expressions:

```javascript
// Priority order for expand-task
1. "complexity-report" - if expansionPrompt exists
2. "research" - if useResearch === true
3. "default" - fallback
```

### Common Conditions

- `useResearch === true` - Research mode enabled
- `appendMode === true` - Append vs replace mode
- `detailLevel === "low"` - Detail level selection
- `tasks.length > 10` - Batch processing threshold

## Token Optimization Strategies

### 1. Prompt Caching
- Templates loaded once and cached
- 15-minute response caching for research

### 2. Variable Optimization
- Only include necessary context
- Use conditional sections
- Minimize JSON serialization

### 3. Streaming Support
- Stream for long responses
- Non-streaming for structured data
- Provider-specific optimizations

## Provider-Specific Features

### Anthropic (Claude)
- Native streaming support
- High context window (200K)
- Best for complex reasoning

### Perplexity (Research)
- Web access for current information
- Optimized for research queries
- Real-time data integration

### OpenAI (GPT)
- Wide model selection
- Good fallback option
- Strong general performance

### Google (Gemini)
- Multiple access methods (AI, Vertex, CLI)
- Large context windows
- Good for analysis tasks

## Error Handling

### Fallback Strategy
1. Try main provider
2. If fails, try fallback provider
3. Log errors for debugging
4. Graceful degradation

### Validation
- Schema validation for prompts
- Parameter type checking
- Template syntax validation
- Provider availability checks

## Performance Considerations

### Caching
- Prompt template caching
- Provider instance caching
- Response caching (15 min)

### Optimization
- Lazy loading of providers
- Singleton pattern for registries
- Efficient template compilation
